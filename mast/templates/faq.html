                    Cyclists will on the other hand tackle famous European races. Such as Giro d'Italia, Tour de France or Vuelta a España.
                    We will tackle this together. However we will count only ten percent of every cycling activity. Lets see how far can we go.

                <p>
                    For each recorded activity you will score some points. Then you need to place in top 10 in any category to win a prize. See <a href="#prizes"> What can I win?</a> section for more information about prizes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The score is computed by a sophisticated formula that takes in account your activity distance, pace and elevation gain and also your sex.
